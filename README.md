# SBD 

## Overview
This barcode datasets contains:

- 100,000 UHR synthetic barcode datasets along with their corresponding bounding boxes ground truth masks.
- 100,000 LR synthetic barcode datasets along with along with their corresponding bounding boxes ground truth masks.

## Size
The LR datasets (~2.2G) could be downloaded here and here and the UHR datasets (~150G) could be downloaded here.

## Reference
The reference paper titled "Fast, Accurate Barcode Detection in Ultra High-Resolution Images" by Quenum et al. introduced the dataset was submitted to to IEEE International Conference on Image Processing, September 2021, USA and coud be found here.
