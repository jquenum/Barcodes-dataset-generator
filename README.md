# SBD (Synthetic Barcode Datasets)

## Overview
This barcode datasets contains:

- 100,000 UHR synthetic barcode datasets along with their corresponding bounding boxes ground truth masks.
- 100,000 LR synthetic barcode datasets along with along with their corresponding bounding boxes ground truth masks.

## Size
The LR datasets (~2.2G) could be downloaded here at [BarcodesLR](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/my-drive).

The UHR datasets (~150G) could be downloaded in 15G increments at [BarcodesUHR00](), [BarcodesUHR01](), [BarcodesUHR02](), [BarcodesUHR03](), [BarcodesUHR04](), [BarcodesUHR05](), [BarcodesUHR06](), [BarcodesUHR07](), [BarcodesUHR08](), [BarcodesUHR09](), [BarcodesUHR10]().
